Nib is an open source pixel art editor I made when I got bored. Open a drawing
or a photo and it turns it into a spread of pixel art versions. Pick one, edit
it, animate it, and export a PNG or a GIF.

## Import

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/import.webp" width="900" alt="Importing a doodle: the original sits beside a grid of twelve reductions, and one is picked">
</p>

Works on doodles and photos alike. Nib shows every version side by side and
you pick one.

- **Line art:** twelve versions, three stroke weights by two to five tones.
- **Colour:** six versions, from 6 to 32 colours.
- **Crop:** drag a square on the original to choose what gets converted.

---

## Draw

Pencil, fill, eyedropper, line, rectangle, ellipse, marquee and lasso
selection, with cut, copy, paste, flip and rotate. Live mirror symmetry, a grid
overlay, a tile preview for patterns that repeat, and fifty levels of undo.

  <img src="docs/media/recolour.webp" width="900" alt="A pixel-art tulip field: three red swatches are each changed to a yellow from the swatch menu, and the field turns from red to yellow in three steps">
</p>

The palette panel shows how many pixels use each colour. Add shades, change any
colour and every pixel using it follows, or switch to a new palette without
losing your edits.

## Animate

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/animate.webp" width="900" alt="Selecting the Stars layer, then Frame, Roll Across Frames, Full turn and Build: the timeline fills with 48 frames and the stars drift behind the penguin">
</p>

Frames across, layers down, in one timeline: click any cell to go straight to
that frame and layer. Per-frame holds, onion skin up to three frames either
side, copy and paste whole frames, and GIF export.

**Roll Across Frames** turns one frame into a loop where one layer moves and the
rest stay still. The header was made this way: only the stars layer rolls, one
cell per frame, for 48 frames.

## Work with Claude <img src="docs/media/clawd.webp" width="100" align="right" alt="Clawd, drawn in Nib, thinking: a bubble fills with three dots, and he blinks">

Nib comes with an MCP server, so Claude can edit your drawings, either a saved
file or the window you have open.

> Hey Claude, working on something in nib. Can you generate me three new
> "starry night" backgrounds behind the penguin?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/claude-options.png" width="840" alt="Three options: Van Gogh, Midnight violet and Dusk horizon, each a different night sky behind the penguin">
</p>

> Liking option 3, can we make some of those stars slightly smaller? Then apply
> it in Nib.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/media/claude-window.png" width="480" alt="The Nib window showing the new sky on its own layer, with the log reading: claude, apply option-1">
</p>

- Options come back as a sheet; nothing changes until you pick one.
- Every change is one undo step.
- If you draw while it works, your strokes are kept and its edit is redone.

Connect it to Claude Code (needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```bash
claude mcp add nib -- uv run --directory /path/to/nib/nib-mcp server.py
```

---

## Install

Needs macOS 14 or later, Xcode or its Command Line Tools
(`xcode-select --install`), and Python 3 with Pillow.

```bash
brew install pillow numpy
git clone https://github.com/jordanpainter/nib.git
cd nib
./bundle.sh
open build/Nib.app
```

Without Homebrew, `python3 -m pip install --user pillow numpy` works too. Nib
finds a Python with Pillow on its own: Homebrew's, conda or miniforge, or the
system one.

`./bundle.sh` builds `Nib.app` with its icon and its Python helper inside, so
you can drag it to Applications. For development, `swift build` and
`.build/debug/Nib` work too, optionally followed by a file to open.

`numpy` is optional. Without it, export looks are unavailable and colour
palettes fall back to a simpler method that can lose small vivid details.

Projects are `.nibart` files: plain JSON holding the layers, every frame, the
palette and the import settings.

## How it is built

```
Swift app  ──JSON lines over a Unix socket──▶  nibd  ──▶  Pillow
    ▲
    └──────  JSON lines over a Unix socket  ──  nib-mcp  ◀──  your Claude
```

The app is SwiftUI and AppKit. The image work lives in `nibd`, a long-lived
Python process, because Pillow does the reduction better than anything Swift
offers without pulling in a framework. `nib-mcp` sends Claude's edits to the
open window as whole documents, so the app keeps no second copy of any tool.

| | |
|---|---|
| `Sources/Nib/` | the app: canvas, timeline, tools, state |
| `nibd/` | quantiser, palette extraction, GIF encoding, effects, looks |
| `nib-mcp/` | the MCP server: tools for Claude, and the live link to the window |
| `docs/` | [what every control does](docs/FUNCTIONALITY.md) |
