"""Turn a source image into a palette-indexed pixel grid.

This is the whole of Nib's v1. No model is involved: downscale, then snap every
pixel to the nearest palette colour. Measured against an LLM painting the same
doodle pixel by pixel, this was ~0.1s versus 7m20s, and the result was better.

The one thing worth getting right is *nearest*. Euclidean distance in raw RGB is
hue-blind: a mid grey can land closer to a cream than to a grey, which speckled a
black-and-white line drawing with yellow. Lab distance fixes that and costs a page
of arithmetic rather than a dependency.

    outline goes grey. The sweet spot moves within one image, so the dial has to.

    The signal has to be regional, and the first attempt got that wrong. Ink
    fraction *per cell* cannot tell one bold stroke from several crowded ones --
    both fill a similar share of the cells they touch -- so it read the castle's
    outline as crowded, refused to thicken it, and broke it up. Blurring the
    coverage over a few cells separates them properly: a lone stroke sits in a
    mostly empty neighbourhood, and fine detail sits in a busy one.
